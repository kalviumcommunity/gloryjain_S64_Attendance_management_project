# Attendance Management System

This is the first phase of our project.

## Setup

* The project uses Java.
* It is managed with Git.

## Execution

To compile and run the application, use the following commands from the root directory:

javac src/com/school/Main.java
java -cp src com.school.Main

## Part 2: Object-Oriented Modeling

In this phase, we implemented the `Student` and `Course` classes to model core entities in the attendance system. The `Main` class was updated to use arrays to manage and display these objects.
